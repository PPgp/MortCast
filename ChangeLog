2.2-0 (05/01/2020)
-----
mortcast() works now with mx defined for 1-year age groups.

2.1-2 (09/27/2019)
-----
Bug fix in computing life table's ax for old ages.

2.1-1 (06/10/2019)
-----
The abridged life table's ax values for ages 5 and 10 changed to 2.5 due to compatibility
with the UN computations.

Adaptive sex-ratio adjustments for copmd() (argument adjust.sr.if.needed).

2.1-0 (04/11/2019)
-----
New method for projecting mortality:
    - logquad and logquadj (implements Log-Quadratic Model of Wilmoth et al. 2012)
    
Bug fix in mltj (thanks to Danan Gu)

Improvements in the documentation (thanks to Danan Gu and Anupreet Porwal)

In the life.table() function, sex option changed from "both" to "total".

    
2.0-1 (03/19/2019)
-----
Added methods for projecting mortality (jointly with Patrick Gerland and Danan Gu):
    - pmd() and its coherent version copmd() 
    - mlt() and mltj()
    - mortcast.blend() for combining two methods
    
Support for computing life tables, including one-year age groups life tables:
    - life.table()

1.2-1 (09/19/2018)
-----
Added a constraint to lx in life tables to be positive (thanks to Julia A. Palacios)

Bug fix: Argument keep.lt = TRUE in the mortcast function now works.

1.2-0 (05/25/2018)
-----
Bug fix (thanks to Julia A. Palacios and Ivan M. Guevara):
- The denominator in averaging ax was T+1. Now corrected to T. 
    As a result, k(t) now sums to zero if ax is averaged over all time periods.

1.1-1 (12/18/2017)
-----
Added reference.

1.1-0 (12/08/2017)
-----
Improvements thanks to suggestions of Marius Pascariu: 
    Functions kannisto.estimate and cokannisto.estimate now also return fitted values 
        and residuals.
    Fixed construction of the resulting matrix in functions kannisto and cokannisto.
    New argument in rotate.leecarter, called e0l, giving the starting e0 level 
        of the rotation  

1.0-1 (11/30/2017)
-----
Initital version.

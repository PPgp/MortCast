Bug fix (thanks to Julia A. Palacios and Ivan M. Guevara):
- The denominator in averaging ax was T+1. Now corrected to T. 
    As a result, k(t) now sums to zero if ax is averaged over all time periods.

Improvements thanks to suggestions of Marius Pascariu: 
    Functions kannisto.estimate and cokannisto.estimate now also return fitted values 
        and residuals.
    Fixed construction of the resulting matrix in functions kannisto and cokannisto.
    New argument in rotate.leecarter, called e0l, giving the starting e0 level 
        of the rotation

\usage{
pmd(e0, mx0, sex = c("male", "female"), interp.rho = FALSE,
  kranges = c(0.01, 25), keep.lt = FALSE, keep.rho = FALSE)

copmd(e0m, e0f, mxm0, mxf0, interp.rho = FALSE, keep.rho = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{e0}{A time series of target life expectancy.}

\item{mx0}{A vector with starting age-specific mortality rates.}

\item{sex}{Either "male" or "female".}

\item{interp.rho}{Logical controlling if the \eqn{\rho} coefficients should be interpolated 
(\code{TRUE}) or if the raw (binned) version should be used (\code{FALSE}), as stored in 
the dataset \code{\link{rhoPMD}}.}

\item{kranges}{A vector of size two, giving the min and max of the \eqn{k} parameter which is 
estimated to match the target \code{e0} using the bisection method.}

\item{keep.lt}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} additional life table columns are kept in the 
resulting object.}

\item{keep.rho}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} the \eqn{\rho} coefficients are included in the resulting object.}

\item{e0m}{A time series of target male life expectancy.}

\item{e0f}{A time series of target female life expectancy.}

\item{mxm0}{A vector with starting age-specific male mortality rates.}

\item{mxf0}{A vector with starting age-specific female mortality rates.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying function. For \code{copmd}, in addition to
\code{kranges} and \code{keep.lt}, it can be \code{sexratio.adjust} which is 
a logical controlling if a sex-ratio adjustment should be applied to prevent crossovers 
between male and female mx. In such a case it uses coefficients from the \code{\link{adjcoefPMD}} dataset. 
However, if the argument \code{adjust.with.mxf} is set to \code{TRUE} (in addition to \code{sexratio.adjust}),
the adjustment is done using the 
female mortality rates as a lower constraint for male mortality rates.}
}
\value{
Function \code{pmd} returns a list with the following elements: a matrix \code{mx}
    with the predicted mortality rates. If \code{keep.lt} is \code{TRUE}, it also 
    contains matrices \code{sr} (survival rates), and life table quantities \code{Lx} and \code{lx}.
    If \code{keep.rho} is \code{TRUE}, it contains a matrix \code{rho} where columns correpond 
    to the values in the \code{e0} vector and rows correspond to age groups.

Function \code{copmd} returns a list with one element for each sex 
    (\code{male} and \code{female}) where each of them is a list as described above.
    In addition if \code{keep.rho} is \code{TRUE}, element \code{rho.sex} 
    gives the sex-dependent (i.e. not averaged) \eqn{\rho_x} coefficient.

\description{
Predict age-specific mortality rates using the Pattern of mortality decline (PMD) method.
}
\details{
These functions implements the PMD method introduced in Andreev et al. (2013). 
    It assumes that the future decline in age-specific mortality will follow a certain pattern 
    with the increase in life expectancy at birth (e0): 
    \deqn{\log mx(t) = \log mx(t-1) - k(t) \rho_x(t)}
    
    Here, \eqn{\rho_x(t)} is the age-specific pattern of mortality decline between \eqn{t-1}
    and \eqn{t}. Such patterns for each sex and various levels of e0 
    are stored in the dataset \code{\link{rhoPMD}}. The \code{pmd} function can be instructed 
    to interpolate between neighboring levels of e0 by setting the argument \code{interp.rho} 
    to \code{TRUE}. The \eqn{k} parameter is estimated to match the e0 level using the bisection 
    method.
    
    Function \code{pmd} evaluates the method for a single sex, while  \code{copmd} does it
    coherently for both sexes. In the latter case, the same \eqn{\rho_x} 
    (namely the average over sex-specific \eqn{\rho_x}) is used 
    for both, male and female.

\title{Mortality Prediction by Method Blending}
\usage{
mortcast.blend(e0m, e0f, meth1 = "lc", meth2 = "mlt", weights = c(1,
  0.5), apply.kannisto = TRUE, min.age.groups = 28,
  meth1.args = NULL, meth2.args = NULL, kannisto.args = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{e0m}{A time series of future male life expectancy.}

\item{e0f}{A time series of future female life expectancy.}

\item{meth1}{Character string giving the name of the first method to blend. It is one of 
\dQuote{lc}, \dQuote{pmd} or \dQuote{mlt}, corresponding to Coherent Lee-Carter (function \code{\link{mortcast}}), 
 Pattern Mortality Decline (function \code{\link{copmd}}) and 
 Model Life Tables (function \code{\link{mltj}}), respectively.}

\item{meth2}{Character string giving the name of the second method to blend. 
One of the same choices as \code{meth1}.}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector with values between 0 and 1 giving the weight of \code{meth1}.
If it is a single value, the same weight is applied for all time periods. 
If it is a vector of size two, it is assumed these are weights for the first and the last
time period. Remaining weights will be interpolated. Note that \code{meth2} is weighted 
by \code{1 - weights}.}

\item{apply.kannisto}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, and any of the methods results in less than 
\code{min.age.groups} age categories, the coherent Kannisto method (\code{\link{cokannisto}}) 
is applied to extend the age groups into old ages.}

\item{min.age.groups}{Minimum number of age groups. Triggers when Kannisto is applied, see above.}

\item{meth1.args}{List of arguments passed to the function that corresponds to \code{meth1}.}

\item{meth2.args}{List of arguments passed to the function that corresponds to \code{meth2}.}

\item{kannisto.args}{List of arguments passed to the \code{\link{cokannisto}} function if Kannisto is applied.}
}
\value{
List with elements \code{female} and \code{male}, each of which contains a matrix \code{mx}
    with the predicted mortality rates. In addition, it contains elements \code{meth1res} and \code{meth2res}
    which contain the results of the functions corresponding to the two methods. 
    Elements \code{meth1} and \code{meth2} contain the names of the methods. 
    A vector \code{weights} contains the final (possibly interpolated) weights.
}
\description{
Predict age-specific mortality rates using a blend of two different methods (Coherent Lee-Carter, 
    Pattern Mortality Decline, or Model Life Tables). Weights can be applied to fine-tune the blending mix.
}
\details{
The function allows to combine two different methods using given weights.
    The weights can change over time - by default they are interpolated from the starting weight 
    to the end weight. The projection is done for both sexes, so that coherent methods can be applied.
